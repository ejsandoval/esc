Based on the Origin and Destination Survey of trips in Santiago 2012, 40% of the trips inside the commune of Santiago are done by foot. To build a data visualization and infographic that told the story behind this data, we simulated the routes of each trip through Google Maps. We colorized them by the declared trip intention for each person's destiny. We also did a categorized segmentation of these trips by time frames of the day. The outcome showed which streets and areas of the commune were more frequented by the given categories, letting the user deduct the kind of buildings and services surrounding each location.

I worked mainly in the primary data visualization: cleaning and formatting the data, getting the route paths, and adding the colors based on the categories.
