Ramas (Branches) is an experimental electronic exercise exploring light and movement that uses the projection of branchesâ€™ shadows with LED lights. The frequency of the light could be manually controlled through a potentiometer. The latter, plus the movement of the module, allowed generated images to change over time, creating the illusion of a light in a forest at night.
