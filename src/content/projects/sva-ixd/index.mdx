Located in New York City, the 2-year MFA in Interaction Design program at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) equips its students with the diverse skills and deep knowledge required to excel in the dynamic field of interaction design. Its curriculum is curated to reflect a wide array of interactions that center accessibility and aren’t just limited to the screen. The focus of our collaboration with the SVA ixD team began with establishing the need for a joyful and future-proof visual identity. This would then become the basis for designing and developing an ADA compliant website to effectively communicate the qualities of the program to current and prospective students.

For this project, I worked as a programmer for one of the accessibility features and a designer for the development of visual assets, brand manual, and data visualizations.
