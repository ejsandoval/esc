Fuente I is an experimental electronic exercise exploring light and movement that uses the image of a projector set under a transparent water container. The interactive sketch was done in Processing and was controlled through hand motion detected through a LeapMotion. The speed of the rotation and the "chaotic" movement were correlated to the speed of the hand movements and the distance to the water's surface. The user could also touch the water, further corrupting the projected image in the ceiling.

I was in charge of defining and developing the interaction of the installation and part of the programming of the sketch.
