Part of the exhibition Habitantes de la Imagen (Inhabitants of the Image), curated by Sofía Garrido, Memoria Asistida (Assisted Memory) is an interactive installation that searched to touch three of the main pillars of the show: the _mediatization_ of the experience, the digital amnesia, the photographic overabundance and the obsolescence of storage devices that leads to oblivion. With a camera connected to a Processing sketch, we applied a glitch effect on top of the face of the visitors as they stare at themselves and the central animation. While they are captured, they can fill the rest of the image with their own glitch by moving around. Once they're gone for a while, the image returns to the original state until another face is detected.

With Osvaldo, we worked on the interaction design and programming of the face filter of the artwork. Whenever the glitch effect of the filter was triggered, we saved an anonymized picture visitor as way to question the initial concepts behind the show. I put together all this picture in a gif after the exhibition was done to reiterate on the idea of media and amnesia.
