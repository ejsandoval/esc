Interrupción is a immersive video experience developed and presented in the context of a new media arts course as it’s final assignment. I developed it with classmate and frequent partner Fernando Florenzano, and showcased it in a video projection room at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. The piece itself looks to display the tension, struggle and anxiety experienced by people on anti retroviral therapy for HIV. We focused it on the potential interruptions that may happen on therapy, either by the health systems that provide it or lack of budget that has become normal during 2025. It included recorded media, live controlled graphics through MIDI controllers and video mapping over physical pill bottles.

On the artwork, we were both part of the conceptualization of the immersive video experience. I built the structure for the video-mapping and controlled the lighting effect over it while showcasing the video.
