Chief is a private mentorship network for women, and their Marketing team needed a new workflow that could scale along with their rapid growth. DSI expanded and systematized Chief's brand across their digital marketing operations by providing a set of tools and workflows for web and email layouts, ready to be integrated into their CRM. By reducing the turnaround from two weeks to less than a day, the Chief team is now able to spend most of its time focusing on the content and creative work needed to power its continued growth.

Inside DSI, I worked as designer and developer for this project project, taking care of the context research planning and execution, the design of the layout components based on their current branding, coding part of the latter, and worked towards the implementation of these design systems into the company.
