Launched in 2022 out of Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP), Digital Witness Lab was pushing new, innovative approaches to public interest investigations through tools that help independent journalists and researchers investigate instances of misinformation and harms in digital technology. DSI built their new brand name and visual identity from scratch, using some generative design principles to explore different permutations of the logo within a dotted grid system. Defining a compelling narrative for the unique communication needs of the Lab, from graphs to strategies helped mitigate the complexity of the data. Effective compositions in line, bar, and dot graphs channeled the flexibility of the grid-dot structure.

For this project, I worked mainly as a graphic designer, helping on the expansion of the visual language into different assets and components, including the execution of the brand manual and the interactive prototypes for data visualization.
