Mil M2 (the spanish for a thousand square meters) is a chilean collective that seeks to create actions that activate critical reflections. During 2020, they took the time to rethink how they document and publish their projects, raising the need for a new website. With <a href="https://sofiagarrido.work/">Sofía Garrido</a>, we took over on the challenge of designing and programming a bilingual website where users could navigate through their long-standing and one-off projects. With a minimal black and white layout, we created a space where the rich collected media leads the visual rhythm of the website.

We tightly worked with Sofía throughout the whole process, where I mainly took care of the developing the website and designing the interactions. The website was built using React and Kirby as a CMS.
