The Coding Train is a learning channel created by Daniel Shiffman about programming and coding for beginners. The videos are sequenced as tutorials –so called tracks– or one off as coding challenges. The initiative was in need of a refresh on their identity and a new website that could be up to the momentum of their online community. We helped Dan to design and build the new platform that presents ways to navigate the content that YouTube couldn't.

In this project, I worked mainly in the initial phase, conducting user research and information architecture along with my coworker Lauren Dukes. Together we interview users from different countries and ages to figure out how they are consuming and navigating the content of the challenge.
