The Coding Train is a learning channel created by Daniel Shiffman about programming and coding for beginners. The videos are sequenced as tutorials –so-called tracks– or one-offs as coding challenges. The initiative needed a refresh of its identity and a new website that could be up to the momentum of its online community. We helped Dan by designing and building a new platform with ways to navigate the content that YouTube couldn't.

The layout, which draws inspiration from the design of train tickets and train tracks' horizontality, consists of a horizontal grid with vertical dividers to create different sections. In these sections, bright and playful typography lives with the characters (created by Jason Heglund) and the website content, creating a dynamic and approachable feeling to the pages.

In this project, I worked mainly in the initial phase, conducting user research and information architecture with my coworker Lauren Dukes. Together, we interview users from different countries and ages to figure out how they are consuming and navigating the content of the challenge. The results informed the content order, naming, and structure and defined how to organize the website’s navigation. New community-driven sections of the website, such as the passenger showcase, were part of the insights of the research.
