EuroMOMO is the European Mortality Monitoring Project. Amidst the first year of the COVID pandemic, we helped them by overhauling their website to face new requirements due the public and scientific interest in their data. The new homepage allowed the high demand and traffic to consume their weekly bulletins, download their datasets and navigate them in interactive graphs and maps. All of this came also with a refresh of the brand that took in consideration the needs of a color palette that could function for the data visualizations.

As part of the DSI's team effort, I worked supporting the development of the website design and the coding of the choropleth map.
