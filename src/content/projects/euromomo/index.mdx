EuroMOMO is the European Mortality Monitoring Project. Amidst the first year of the COVID pandemic, we helped them overhaul their website to face new requirements due to the public and scientific interest in their data. The new homepage allowed the high demand and traffic to consume their weekly bulletins, download their datasets, and navigate them in interactive graphs and maps. This change also came with a brand refresh that considered the need for a color palette that could function for the data visualizations.

As part of the DSI's team effort, I supported the website design development and the choropleth map's coding.
