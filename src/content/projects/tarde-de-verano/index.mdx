"Tarde de Verano" (Summer's Afternoon) is a _coral_ play written by Ana Corbalán and directed by Ángelo Solari. It follows a trip of two young travelers, a lady who lost her dogs, two city guards, some beach people, and the two missing dogs. In the play, every element follows a musical and orchestrated rhythm: the lights, the dialogues, the actors' movements. In the center of the stage, a tall tree with three screens mounted on top acts as another character of the play, enhancing some words as they are spoken or adding to the visual musicality of the play.

The challenge was to create a screen that could be used live, almost like an instrument, displaying text and color as the play unraveled. To achieve this, I made an interface in TouchDesigner that allowed a user to change the texts with timings and animations pre-defined by the director. The patch was connected to the monitors and had operators for setting up the order of the screens. In addition, the screens had two optional resting states for when the screen wasn't at the front of the scene.
