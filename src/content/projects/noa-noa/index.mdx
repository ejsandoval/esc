Noa Noa was an electronic music venue located at the heart of Santiago. We designed a brand system, the physical space with a connected screen for visuals –plus four more independent screens–and a new website. The venue's team used an accompanying set of digital tools hosted on the website to create weekly assets for social media, such as Instagram stories, and update the content on every venue screen. The upcoming lineup, the bar's menu, and the current DJs were exhibited through the screens and could be updated remotely through Wi-Fi.

The visual identity drew inspiration from old marquees's movement and layout. The horizontal motion and stacked nature were part of the principles of the brand. Adding the amber color from the low-resolution led modules used across the venue gave the physical space and digital outputs a recognizable and consistent look. During its lifespan before the COVID pandemic hit, the venue became a renowned part of the city's nightlife.

My work mainly consisted of the initial exploration of the visual language through typography, layout and images, and the building of all the screens in the venue.
