Noa Noa was an electronic music venue located at the heart of Santiago. We designed a brand system, the physical space with a connected screen for visuals –plus four more independent screens–, and a new website. An accompanying set of digital tools, which were hosted on the latter, were used by the venue's team to create weekly assets for social media, as instagram stories, and update the content on every screen of the venue. The upcoming lineup, the bar's menu and the current djs were exhibit through the screens and could be updated remotely through wi-fi.

The visual identity drew inspiration from old marquees's movement and layout. The horizontal motion and stacked nature were part of the principles of the brand. Adding the amber color from the low resolution led modules used across the venue, gave a recognizable and consistent look to the physical space and digital outputs. During its lifespan before the COVID pandemic hit, the venue became a renowned part of city's nightlife.

My work consisted mostly in the initial exploration of the visual language through typography, layout and images, and the building of all the screens that were installed in the venue.
