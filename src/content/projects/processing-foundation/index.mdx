Processing and the Processing Foundation contacted us to re-design their 00' website, which had remained the same for over a decade. As one of the essential software related to creative coding, this re-design process had to be mindful of their well-established community. Learning how educators and students used the software and the website was a fundamental process requirement. For this reason, the project's kickoff was centered on qualitative research conducted with users to understand their overall perception of Processing, its community, and how they related to the software.

The re-design of the website came with a new visual language that looked to refresh the overall Processing brand further than the .org. Following the conceptual legacy behind the software, the new identity is focused on a drawing system –a sketch– with an 8x8 grid where the strokes must be anchored on the grid intersections and have a stroke width of 1.5 times the grid module size. By tweaking the color and the scales, the system opens a spectrum between technical and human, depending on the application.

The website welcomes users with a fully interactive version of the logo sketch where they can tweak the positions and colors of the strokes and their bezier curve handlers. This visual first approach is present across the website, especially in the examples where the visual outputs are part of the index, showcasing what is possible to create with code.

Inside DSI, I led this project, taking care of the research planning and execution, the design of the new website, coding part of the latter, and conducting user testing sessions with actual users of the Processing software for further improvements.
