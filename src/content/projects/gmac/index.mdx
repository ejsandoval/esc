For nearly 75 years, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) has supported people on their higher education journey. As a pivot to their current business, we helped them to conceptualize from the scratch a candidate-first app called Advancery that guides business aspirants at every step of their career growth. To support the data-heavy nature of career research, GMAC Advancery was built as a desktop-first web application with an accompanying mobile experience. This allowed the application to handle complex display of information and a feature set close to that of a spreadsheet.

For this project, I worked as a UX researcher, a designer of the visual language, features and web components, and a programmer assisting in features like the initial assessment, the explore view and the comparison tool.
